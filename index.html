<P> BAE (Boundless Athletics Engine) helps Princeton students discover and take advantage of the variety of fitness and athletics opportunities and resources on campus. Currently, if you want to exercise and/or try something new, there is no easy way to find out what you can do because all of the athletics and fitness information is spread out over numerous sites. BAE consolidates all of this information in an easy-to-use website to make staying active fun, easy, and interesting!
